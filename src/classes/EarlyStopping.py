ALNS (Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search) implementation for PDPTW
Using the ALNS library https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS/tree/master
to solve Li-Lim benchmark instances download files from https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/pdptw/li-lim-benchmark/

Data instances The format of the data files is as follows:

The first line gives the number of vehicles, the capacity, and the speed (not used)
From the second line, for each customer (starting with the depot):
The index of the customer
The x coordinate
The y coordinate
The demand
The earliest arrival
The latest arrival
The service time
The index of the corresponding pickup order (0 if the order is a pickup)
The index of the corresponding delivery order (0 if the order is a delivery)
